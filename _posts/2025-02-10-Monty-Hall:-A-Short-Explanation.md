The Monty Hall problem, based on the game show **Let's Make A Deal**, still stumps a lot of people.  
I arrived at the following short explanation over lunch one day with coworkers.  
<!--more-->   
First, a brief explanation of the rules and the question.
1. The host, Monty Hall, shows a contestant three closed doors, numbered 1, 2 and 3.  Behind one door is a valuable prize, and behind the other two are worthless prizes, usually a goat or a much less valuable prize.  
2. The contestant first choose a door, at random.
3. Then Monty opens one of the doors the contestant did not choose, revealing a goat or very low value prize. Important: He never reveals the prize at this point.
4. Monty then tries to persuade the contestant to change their mind, offering cash in some case.

The question is:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Should the contestant stay with their choice, or switch their choice to the other closed door?*

The simple explanation:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Two thirds of the time: (You choose one wrong door and the host shows you the other wrong door).**

It really is that simple. Two thirds of the time: you chose one of the wrong doors, the host shows you the other wrong door, and you should switch.  I add the parentheses here to emphasize that the two clauses in parentheses happen together. 

You also can work this out by making a table of all the possible games and choices. There aren't that many.

It's interesting that a lot of effort and (virtual) ink is still used in concocting detailed explanations, often with some fairly advanced probability theory!
